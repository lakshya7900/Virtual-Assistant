 **************** 



Dear School Authorities,

I am writing to humbly request a one week leave from school as I have to attend a marriage. I understand that it is important to stay in school and continue learning, however, this is an important occasion that I must attend and would appreciate your understanding and help.

I am a regular student and have been performing well in my studies, and I promise to make up for the missed classes upon my return to school.

I would like to thank you for your kind consideration and understanding.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
