OpenAI response for Prompt: using ai write me a python code that checks whether the user input number is even or odd 
 **************** 

Sure! Here's a Python code that checks whether the user input number is even or odd:

```python
# Get the user input number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Check if the number is even or odd
if num % 2 == 0:
    print(num, "is even")
else:
    print(num, "is odd")
```

Here's how the code works:

1. It prompts the user to enter a number using the `input()` function and converts the input to an integer using `int()`.
2. It then checks if the number is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator `%`. If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.
3. If the number is even, it prints a message stating that the number is even. Otherwise, it prints a message stating that the number is odd.
